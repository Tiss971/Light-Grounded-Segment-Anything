We plan to create a very interesting demo by combining [Grounding DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO) and [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) which aims to detect and segment anything with text inputs! And we will continue to improve it and create more interesting demos based on this foundation. And we have already released an overall technical report about our project on arXiv, please check [Grounded SAM: Assembling Open-World Models for Diverse Visual Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14159) for more details.

We are very willing to **help everyone share and promote new projects** based on Segment-Anything, Please check out here for more amazing demos and works in the community: [Highlight Extension Projects](#highlighted-projects). You can submit a new issue (with `project` tag) or a new pull request to add new project's links.

**üçÑ Why Building this Project?**

The **core idea** behind this project is to **combine the strengths of different models in order to build a very powerful pipeline for solving complex problems**. And it's worth mentioning that this is a workflow for combining strong expert models, where **all parts can be used separately or in combination, and can be replaced with any similar but different models (like replacing Grounding DINO with GLIP or other detectors / replacing Stable-Diffusion with ControlNet or GLIGEN/ Combining with ChatGPT)**.

## Installation
The code requires `python>=3.8`, as well as `pytorch>=1.7` and `torchvision>=0.8`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended.

### Install with Docker

Open one terminal:

```
make build-image
```

```
make run
```

That's it.

If you would like to allow visualization across docker container, open another terminal and type:

```
xhost +
```


### Install without Docker
You should set the environment variable manually as follows if you want to build a local GPU environment for Grounded-SAM:
```bash
export AM_I_DOCKER=False
export BUILD_WITH_CUDA=True
export CUDA_HOME=/path/to/cuda-11.3/
```

Install Segment Anything:

```bash
python -m pip install -e segment_anything
```

Install Grounding DINO:

```bash
python -m pip install -e GroundingDINO
# If error, try this :
# When using build isolation, PyTorch with newer CUDA is installed and can't compile GroundingDINO
python -m pip install --no-cache-dir wheel
python -m pip install --no-cache-dir --no-build-isolation -e GroundingDINO

```


Install diffusers:

```bash
pip install --upgrade diffusers[torch]
```

Install osx:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd grounded-sam-osx && bash install.sh
```

Install RAM & Tag2Text:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xinyu1205/recognize-anything.git
pip install -r ./recognize-anything/requirements.txt
pip install -e ./recognize-anything/
```

The following optional dependencies are necessary for mask post-processing, saving masks in COCO format, the example notebooks, and exporting the model in ONNX format. `jupyter` is also required to run the example notebooks.

```
pip install opencv-python pycocotools matplotlib onnxruntime onnx ipykernel
```

More details can be found in [install segment anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything#installation) and [install GroundingDINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO#install) and [install OSX](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/OSX)

### :running_man: GroundingDINO: Detect Everything with Text Prompt

:grapes: [[arXiv Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05499)] &nbsp; :rose:[[Try the Colab Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/roboflow-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/zero-shot-object-detection-with-grounding-dino.ipynb)] &nbsp; :sunflower: [[Try Huggingface Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ShilongLiu/Grounding_DINO_demo)] &nbsp; :mushroom: [[Automated Dataset Annotation and Evaluation](https://youtu.be/C4NqaRBz_Kw)]

Here's the step-by-step tutorial on running `GroundingDINO` demo:

**Step 1: Download the pretrained weights**

```bash
cd Grounded-Segment-Anything

# download the pretrained groundingdino-swin-tiny model
wget https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO/releases/download/v0.1.0-alpha/groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth
```

**Step 2: Running the demo**

```bash
python grounding_dino_demo.py
```

<details>
<summary> <b> Running with Python (same as demo but you can run it anywhere after installing GroundingDINO) </b> </summary>

```python
from groundingdino.util.inference import load_model, load_image, predict, annotate
import cv2

model = load_model("GroundingDINO/groundingdino/config/GroundingDINO_SwinT_OGC.py", "./groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth")
IMAGE_PATH = "assets/demo1.jpg"
TEXT_PROMPT = "bear."
BOX_THRESHOLD = 0.35
TEXT_THRESHOLD = 0.25

image_source, image = load_image(IMAGE_PATH)

boxes, logits, phrases = predict(
    model=model,
    image=image,
    caption=TEXT_PROMPT,
    box_threshold=BOX_THRESHOLD,
    text_threshold=TEXT_THRESHOLD
)

annotated_frame = annotate(image_source=image_source, boxes=boxes, logits=logits, phrases=phrases)
cv2.imwrite("annotated_image.jpg", annotated_frame)
```

</details>
<br>

**Tips**
- If you want to detect multiple objects in one sentence with [Grounding DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO), we suggest separating each name with `.` . An example: `cat . dog . chair .`

**Step 3: Check the annotated image**

The annotated image will be saved as `./annotated_image.jpg`.

<div align="center">

| Text Prompt | Demo Image | Annotated Image |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| `Bear.` | ![](./assets/demo1.jpg)  | ![](./assets/annotated_image.jpg) |
| `Horse. Clouds. Grasses. Sky. Hill` | ![](./assets/demo7.jpg)  | ![](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/detrex-storage/blob/main/assets/grounded_sam/grounding_dino/groundingdino_demo7.jpg?raw=true)

</div>


### :running_man: Grounded-SAM: Detect and Segment Everything with Text Prompt

Here's the step-by-step tutorial on running `Grounded-SAM` demo:

**Step 1: Download the pretrained weights**

```bash
cd Grounded-Segment-Anything

wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth
wget https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO/releases/download/v0.1.0-alpha/groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth
```

We provide two versions of Grounded-SAM demo here:
- [grounded_sam_demo.py](./grounded_sam_demo.py): our original implementation for Grounded-SAM.
- [grounded_sam_simple_demo.py](./grounded_sam_simple_demo.py) our updated more elegant version for Grounded-SAM.

**Step 2: Running original grounded-sam demo**

```python
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
python grounded_sam_demo.py \
  --config GroundingDINO/groundingdino/config/GroundingDINO_SwinT_OGC.py \
  --grounded_checkpoint groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth \
  --sam_checkpoint sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth \
  --input_image assets/demo1.jpg \
  --output_dir "outputs" \
  --box_threshold 0.3 \
  --text_threshold 0.25 \
  --text_prompt "bear" \
  --device "cuda"
```

The annotated results will be saved in `./outputs` as follows

<div align="center">

| Input Image | Annotated Image | Generated Mask |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| ![](./assets/demo1.jpg) | ![](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/detrex-storage/blob/main/assets/grounded_sam/grounded_sam/original_grounded_sam_demo1.jpg?raw=true) | ![](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/detrex-storage/blob/main/assets/grounded_sam/grounded_sam/mask.jpg?raw=true) |

</div>

**Step 3: Running grounded-sam demo with sam-hq**
- Download the demo image
```bash
wget https://github.com/IDEA-Research/detrex-storage/releases/download/grounded-sam-storage/sam_hq_demo_image.png
```

- Download SAM-HQ checkpoint [here](https://github.com/SysCV/sam-hq#model-checkpoints)

- Running grounded-sam-hq demo as follows:
```python
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
python grounded_sam_demo.py \
  --config GroundingDINO/groundingdino/config/GroundingDINO_SwinT_OGC.py \
  --grounded_checkpoint checkpoints/groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth \
  --sam_hq_checkpoint checkpoints/sam_hq_vit_h.pth \  # path to sam-hq checkpoint
  --use_sam_hq \  # set to use sam-hq model
  --input_image sam_hq_demo_image.png \
  --output_dir "outputs" \
  --box_threshold 0.3 \
  --text_threshold 0.25 \
  --text_prompt "chair." \
  --device "cuda"
```

The annotated results will be saved in `./outputs` as follows

<div align="center">

| Input Image | SAM Output | SAM-HQ Output |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| ![](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/detrex-storage/blob/main/assets/grounded_sam/sam_hq/sam_hq_demo.png?raw=true) | ![](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/detrex-storage/blob/main/assets/grounded_sam/sam_hq/sam_output.jpg?raw=true) | ![](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/detrex-storage/blob/main/assets/grounded_sam/sam_hq/sam_hq_output.jpg?raw=true) |

</div>

**Step 4: Running the updated grounded-sam demo (optional)**

Note that this demo is almost same as the original demo, but **with more elegant code**.

```python
python grounded_sam_simple_demo.py
```

The annotated results will be saved as `./groundingdino_annotated_image.jpg` and `./grounded_sam_annotated_image.jpg`

<div align="center">

### :label: Grounded-SAM with RAM or Tag2Text for Automatic Labeling
[**The Recognize Anything Models**](https://github.com/OPPOMKLab/recognize-anything) are a series of open-source and strong fundamental image recognition models, including [RAM++](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15200), [RAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03514) and [Tag2text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05657).


It is seamlessly linked to generate pseudo labels automatically as follows:
1. Use RAM/Tag2Text to generate tags.
2. Use Grounded-Segment-Anything to generate the boxes and masks.


**Step 1: Init submodule and download the pretrained checkpoint**

- Init submodule:

```bash
cd Grounded-Segment-Anything
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

- Download pretrained weights for `GroundingDINO`, `SAM` and `RAM/Tag2Text`:

```bash
wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth
wget https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO/releases/download/v0.1.0-alpha/groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth


wget https://huggingface.co/spaces/xinyu1205/Tag2Text/resolve/main/ram_swin_large_14m.pth
wget https://huggingface.co/spaces/xinyu1205/Tag2Text/resolve/main/tag2text_swin_14m.pth
```

**Step 2: Running the demo with RAM**
```bash
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
python automatic_label_ram_demo.py \
  --config GroundingDINO/groundingdino/config/GroundingDINO_SwinT_OGC.py \
  --ram_checkpoint ram_swin_large_14m.pth \
  --grounded_checkpoint groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth \
  --sam_checkpoint sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth \
  --input_image assets/demo9.jpg \
  --output_dir "outputs" \
  --box_threshold 0.25 \
  --text_threshold 0.2 \
  --iou_threshold 0.5 \
  --device "cuda"
```


**Step 2: Or Running the demo with Tag2Text**
```bash
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
python automatic_label_tag2text_demo.py \
  --config GroundingDINO/groundingdino/config/GroundingDINO_SwinT_OGC.py \
  --tag2text_checkpoint tag2text_swin_14m.pth \
  --grounded_checkpoint groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth \
  --sam_checkpoint sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth \
  --input_image assets/demo9.jpg \
  --output_dir "outputs" \
  --box_threshold 0.25 \
  --text_threshold 0.2 \
  --iou_threshold 0.5 \
  --device "cuda"
```

- RAM++ significantly improves the open-set capability of RAM, for [RAM++ inference on unseen categoreis](https://github.com/xinyu1205/recognize-anything#ram-inference-on-unseen-categories-open-set).
- Tag2Text also provides powerful captioning capabilities, and the process with captions can refer to [BLIP](#robot-run-grounded-segment-anything--blip-demo).
- The pseudo labels and model prediction visualization will be saved in `output_dir` as follows (right figure):
